# I Want To Be A Web Developer

Inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/README.md), this list is my personal study plan for building towards my goal of becoming a web developer. 

## Pull Request Is Warmly Welcomed

Please don't hesitate to recommend any resources you think are helpful. Thank you!

## Let's Do It Together

Peer learning is always better than learning alone.

I mostly code in Sydney, so feel free to come along for a coding ride if you are around. (all levels are welcome!)

Or you can shoot me emails @ dennisboys@gmail.com.
